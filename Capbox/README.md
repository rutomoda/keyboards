Capbox - 3D printable storage containers for keycap layouts
===
Capbox are modular keycap storage containers meant to make it easy to switch keysets on your favorite keyboard and conveniently store currently unused ones for later or making it easy to package and send to a buyer them after selling them on the market. 

6x4 layout
---
Originally designed to cover 12x4 grid keyboards. Was split into two halfs to be more flexible and be able to be printed on smaller 3D printers.

8x5 layout
---
Planned to cover keyboard sizes up to 65% as well as cover row staggered layouts. Also split into two halfs for more flexiblity and better 3D printer support. Currently work in progress.

General design
---
Each 1U pocket is 18.7mm by 18.7mm which should give a nice fit with most keycaps. The default height of each Capbox pocket is 10mm. This means high profile keycaps like SA or MT3 are only supported by files marked as "hipro". The pockets are dimensioned to allow for a good keycap fit while still maintaining good accessibility. 

Overall height per Capbox is 13mm. Capbox of the same size are stackable. The long sides feature clips which offer some holding force, but not much. Those clips break rather easily due to 3D printing layer adhesion issues and it is recommended to break them out completely and switch to rubber bands if secure holding is required. There are also index pins on the short sides allowing for percise stacking even without the clips. These pin are designed as breakable in case a laser cut, flat plate
is supposed to be used, instead of the 3D printable lid.

Several Capboxes can be connected via dovetail connections on the short sides. These dovetails are dimensioned for a friction fit. The big disadvantage of this friction fit is that it noticably changes with tolerance changes around 0.02mm. The fit works over a wider range of tolerance, but can feel "too tight" or "too loose" rather quickly. This only concerns the friction fit part of the dovetails. The general dovetail interlocking is way more tolerant regarding
tolerances.

Capbox is optimized for 0.35mm layer height PLA prints with a 0.4mm nozzle. These are thought to be most commonly available and fastest setting for printing. For other print settings tolerances, fits and layer adhesion might vary. With poorer layer adhesion clips will break more easily. Tolerances due to extrusion with will mainly impact the dovetail friction fit. All prints can be done without support structures when the Capbox bottom is oriented towards the print bed.
