Ellipsis Keyboard Case
===
The Ellipsis is inspired by The Ave by @the_royal_of_reddit on Instagram and adapted to a 4x6 split keyboard powered by a Let's Split or Keebio Levinson PCB.

Being an asymmetrical split keyboard each top part has two mirrored sides. Which side is used as left and right is not specified in this design. The bottom part is the same for either side.

Rev 1

One-of handwire version planned for myself with an 3mm integrated plate. Accepts the Let's Split and Keebio Levinson PCB. Angled switches and LEDs must be handwired and manually added to the QMK firmware. The case has no screws and an optional gasket mount by using 2-3mm rubber tubing glued into the groove of the bottom. Cables are supposed to have angled connectors and are hidden within the case after connecting. Not having screws allows for easy access for connecting and hitting the
reset button. Cables may not be thicker than 6mm in diameter. Connectors may have to be ground flat if too thick.
