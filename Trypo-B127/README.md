Trypo-B127 Switch Spring Case
===
Just a little case for 127 switch springs so they don't jump around everywhere. 

3D Printing should be possible without additional supports for FDM and SLA (smallest dimension is 0.5mm, angles are optimized for supportless printing).

The halves are held together by a friction fit.
