BOENT
===
Designed to be manufacturable from bent sheet metal as well as being 3D printable BOENT is a simplistic approach to keyboard storage and display. BOENT can be fixed vertically as well as horizontally. Designed to be used as at least a pair it can accommodate even the widest, highest and thickest keyboards. In the front is an optional mounting opportunity for an name and specification plaque or a simple reinforcement plate to use a BOENT pair as a standalone storage or display stand.
